My name is Guillermo Guerini. I'm 28 years old, born and raised in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I started working with IT when I was only 13 and my first project was to create the company's new website. By that time I had already taught myself HTML and CSS using Notepad.exe. After this, Javascript, server side technologies and other languages came naturally. For more than 10 years I focused on Microsoft technologies like ASP, VB6 and later on .NET, C# and ASP.NET.

In 2008 I decided to take a break and started traveling the world. I've been to places in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, South America and North America. It was definitely the best thing I could do for myself. In between these travels, I did a lot of freelancing and that was the second best thing. Not having guidelines and directions to be followed from a big organization, I opened my eyes to different technologies and especially to the open source community. This is when I started to learn Ruby on Rails.

Wrapping up, I'm a Software Developer with 10+ years of experience focused on web and mobile technologies.

__Personal Stuff__

When I'm not coding, I will probably be doing one of the following things:

- Hanging out with my amazing girlfriend wife Leah Gregory
- Running
- Playing with our dog Pepper
- Traveling
- Eating
- Taking pictures and Instagraming them
- Reading and learning something new
