In less than 7 days, I'll do my first Olympic distance Triathlon. I can feel the excitement building up and I know it's only going to get "worse" from now on. This will be my second triathlon. In 2014 I wanted to do something challenging to celebrate my 30th birthday and I signed up for a Sprint distance (0.25mi/400m swim, 10mi/16km bike, 3.1mi/5km run). It was a great experience and I knew I would do more triathlon events in the future. 

Last year, to celebrate my 31st birthday, I ran a full marathon. That race was definitely way more difficult than a sprint triathlon but it was the moment I realized I was ready to take bigger challenges and see where my body could take me. 

So this year I signed up for the [Boston Triathlon](http://www.bostontri.com/), which will take place at Carson Beach, South Boston. I'll be swimming 0.9mi/1.5km, biking 22mi/35km and finishing with a 6mi/10km run. Still not as challenging as a marathon but this is the first step towards higher goals. I'm looking at you [Ironman](http://www.ironman.com). 

## Training

I've been trying to focus my training on the swim and bike parts. Swimming is, like many people, my weakest sport. I never thought I'd be able to swim 1mi non-stop, but I'm almost there. I'm aware my technique is ~~terrible~~ not so great but I didn't have time to relearn how to swim, improve my strokes and get the endurance needed in a short period of time. Lots of room for improvement here. 

Cycling is also a "new" sport for me. I've had many bikes throughout my life but I've never seen it as a sport. The purpose of a bike was to take me to places. That's still the case but it's also an essential part of a triathlon. I recently brought my dad's road bike from Brazil and I've been having a lot of fun with the long rides. I also bought a trainer ([Tax Vortex Smart](https://www.tacx.com/products/trainers/vortex-smart)) that will allow me to improve my skills right in my basement, specialty during the Boston's brutal winters. 

Last but not least, my favorite sport: running. This is the sport I'm more familiar with. I've been running for a long time and I really enjoy it. The only problem is since my marathon back in October '15 I've been struggling with my IT band. I should have gone to a doctor, but I decided to use [Dr. Google](https://www.google.com) instead. It's definitely better and the pain I feel when I go for longer runs is not nearly as bad as it used to be, if it hurts at all. But I regret not taking care of it from day one. 

Overall, I think I'm in good shape and I'll be able to swim + bike + run, hopefully, without issues. I'm looking forward to next weekend and I'm pretty sure I'll have a good time.
