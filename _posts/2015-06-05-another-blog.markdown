I can't remember how many times I've started a blog in the past 10 years. I'm usually very excited in the beginning, but two or three posts later (yes, that much!), I would totally abandon it. Today, for some reason, I feel different. I have some exciting things to share and I'd like to start the habit of writing more. When I'm writing, I'm forced to slow down in order to organize my thoughts. My mind is always busy thinking about everything at the same time and I feel overwhelmed.

Let's see how it goes. Welcome!
